        Website Review - Due 2/4/2013
	a. Find 5 websites and identify the following:
	   i. Who is the audience for the website
	  ii. Can you identify the use of the golden ratio? Where?

	  1)	https://www.esurance.com

	  i.	The audience for this site would be anyone who is trying to
	  save money on their insurance plan.

	  ii.	The site does make use the golden ratio, both horizontally and
	  vertically. The front page for example is evenly divided into 4
	  parts. Their call to action sits on the top left hand side of the
	  site. Below it is a list of their products and claims. The right hand
	  side is also evenly divided between their product advertisements and
	  a Log In form for their current customers. Additionally, all their
	  most important information sits above the fold on their front page,
	  so that new visitors don't have to scroll down to find any specific
	  link.
	  
	  
	  2)	http://www.tdbank.com
	  
	  i.	This site seems to be addressing people who are interested in
	  online banking. The site promotes electronic banking by advertising
	  "going green". They offer personal, small business and corporate
	  banking, so their audience is pretty large.
	  
	  ii.	The site does use the golden ratio. It is proportionally
	  distributed between the header, footer, sidebar and main content
	  block. The main content block is roughly 555 pixels, with the sidebar
	  being about 185 pixels in width.
	  
	  
	  3)	http://www.blurb.com
	  
	  i.	The audience for this site are people who want to create photo
	  books. The site is promoting easy to make, affordable photo books.
	  
	  ii.	Yes, the site does make good use of the golden ratio. The
	  information is evenly distributed on the front page. Additionally,
	  all of their important information, like their call to action sits on
	  the right place.
	  
	  
	  4)	http://www.ibuypower.com
	  
	  i.	The audience for this site would be people who want to purchase
	  or build high end gaming computers.
	  
	  ii.	The site doesn't seem to make very good use of the golden
	  ratio. The information is not evenly distributed, and for the most
	  part sits below the fold when a visitor opens the site.
	  
	  
	  5)	http://www.sportsauthority.com
	  
	  i.	The audience for this site would be sports fans.
	  
	  ii.	The site does seem to make use of the golden ratio. The
	  information on the site is evenly distributed with the most important
	  adds sitting above the fold.
