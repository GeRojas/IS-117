My name is Gerardo Rojas, and I am a junior IS major here at NJIT. Before coming to
NJIT I attended the Arts Institute in New York City, where I received an associate's
degree in visual arts. During my time at the Arts Institute I took an entry level HTML
course which sparked my interest in web design. I became interested in pursuing a
computing degree short after graduating the Arts Institute, and realizing that
everything revolves around technology these days. I have spent the last few years
working for a small graphic design company, where I have expanded my knowledge of Adobe
Design software.
